    <h2> Professionally </h2>
        <p>
            I have spent more years in post-secondary education than in the work force. After graduating
            from high school I came to UNO to work on pre-veterinary requirements, well, life happens, I
            transferred to Metro Community College (MCC) and earned an Associates (AA) in Graphic Design.
            This degree turned out to be worthless, at that time all the jobs in this field were on the
            coast. After serving a brief period in the Navy and getting some schooling as an electronic
            technician I went back to MCC working towards an AA in Accounting this time. After a year and
            reaching CPA level classes I figured out it wasn't for me. Several years, and a divorce later,
            I was able to go to Iowa Western Community College and get a degree in Veterinary Technology
            and become a licensed Veterinary Technician. I secured a good job on Offutt AFB and all was
            well until the Army took us over, and it was down hill from there. That brings me to were I am
            today, back where I began years ago at UNO. This time pursuing a degree in Information
            Technology, specifically Management Information Systems and I should graduate in Spring of 2019.
            Currently I am working in a job about as far from IT as one could get - a Yarn Store.
