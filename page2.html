                I <span class="italics"> <span class="bold"> love</span> </span> animals, isn't a critter on
                this earth I don't like. I wanted to be a vet when I was little. I had pets growing up and I
                have pets now. There was a brief 2 year period when it was just my son and me living on our
                own when we didn't have a pet, not even a fish. Very sad, lonley years. Currently, I have a
                crested gecko, a leachianus gecko, an Eclectus Parrot (like and African Grey but neon green),
                and <span class="bold"> 2</span> dogs. </p>
            <p>
                I have a super snuggly French Bulldog, Tangelo (the photo above), and a sweetheart English
                Bulldog, EBea Mae (photo below).
